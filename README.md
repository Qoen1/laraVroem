# LaraVroem

LaraVroem is an application that enables people to easily track and share car expenses based on the amount they have driven in the car. Users can add eachother to a car, and enter the odometer status at the end of each drive. Once someone has filled up the gas tank they can enter that too, and will be able to easily see how much gas each other person has used, so they can share the cost accordingly.

this application was created because I shara a car with my brothers, with vastly different amounts of driven kilometers per month. It would not be fair to evenly split the gas among us, so we needed a way to find out how much everyone drives. 

I hope to add a lot more functionality in the future, such as the ability to track and share maintanence cost, more data insight, and other things.

the application is already hosted on https://vroemsheet.nl so if you want to check it out you can.
